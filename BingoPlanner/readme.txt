BingoPlanner
created by Dessyreqt

BingoPlanner is an application that reads bingo cards from SpeedRunsLive. It 
provides a more extensive interface for planning and tracking your current 
bingo goal and should work well for all forms of bingo practiced on SRL.

Here's a list of functions:

Seed Only: This loads a bingo card from SRL based off the game name, seed 
	number, and bingo type provided. This doesn't support non-English cards.

WebAddress: This loads the bingo from the web address specified. This is 
	useful if you want to copy/paste the link, or want to view a non-English 
	card.

Left-click a square: Colors a square green. If it's already green, colors it 
	red.

Right-click a square: Colors a square red. If it's already red, colors it 
	green.

Ctrl-left-click or middle-click a square: Colors a square blue. If it's 
	already blue, colors it orange.

Ctrl-right-click a square: Colors a square yellow. If it's already yellow, 
	colors it blue.

Shift-left-click a square: Increments the progress number listed after a goal. 
	This is useful if a goal requires you to collect a certain number of an 
	item.

Shift-right-click a square: Decrements the progress number listed after a 
	goal.
